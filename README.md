# Scripts_Google_Earth_Engine

Here I show some Google Earth Engine (GEE) codes (javascript) that I have used in some projects.

Age_class_regeneration shows statistics of the age of secondary forests estimates by the MapBiomas (https://mapbiomas.org/en/deforestation-method) project.

Sentinel_NDVI_Trend shows the NDVI index trend through time considering the multispectral sensor data onboard the Sentinel satellite.

VIs_mean_std_specific_months shows basic statistics of Vegetation Indexes (VIs) according to multispectral sensor data onboard the Landsat and Sentinel satellites. This scripts allows checking this data on specific periods that the user wants to check.
